- First released version.


xvidcore.library 52.2 (3.6.2009)

- Updated xvidcore to version 1.2.2.

- Enabled altivec support in xvidcore.


xvidcore.library 53.1 (xx.xx.2017)

- Updated xvidcore to version 1.3.4.

- Disabled pthread code in xvidcore for now. Since AmigaOS doesn't support SMP
  currently it doesn't serve any useful purpose and it was not working before
  anyway because the libpthread constructor/destructor functions were not
  executed.
